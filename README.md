# ESP_Configuration
A non-volatile configuration library for the ESP8266 Arduino Core

This is a basic Configuration library for the ESP8266 Arduino Core.

Developed to be used to store things like IP addresses, passwords, enums between boots.
Uses the SPIFFS of the ESP, and has been tested to work with EEPROM if required.

And questions or comments feel free to leave an issue.
